## Briefly about the project

The main purpose of this project is to create a sandbox framework for me where I can try and play with new technologies in REACT JS environment. It seemed a pretty good idea to build up a Windows 10-like application because it has a bunch of special kind of features which are totally different than a classic website.

## Config & Install

You need to install the **REACT JS** and set the IDEA to start the project with npm start command or type it manually at every app launch. To run the app in the development mode, please open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

**IMPORTANT INFORMATION:**

**You need to get the '.env' file which contains the necessary environment variables for the normal operation of the app.** This file is not uploaded to GitHub because of security reasons.
